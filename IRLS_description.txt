Description of IRLS:


	1) d1_logli function: Calculate the first derivative of log-likelihood of Bernoulli distribution with logit link.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo.
		Not used in any function.
	
	2) logli function: Calculate the log-likelihood of Bernoulli distribution with logit link.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo.
	
	3) beta_calculator: Update beta by IRLS.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: beta
		written in Rcpp-Armadillo
		The equation is included in "IRLS_equations" file
	
	4) optim_irls: Loop the optimization process.
		Takes X: design matrix, Y: response vector, beta: Initial beta,
			logL: initial value of log-likelihood, eps, tolerance, maxit
		written in R
		The convergence criteria is the relative change of log-likelihood
		output: beta estimates, Log-likelihood at beta estimates, iteration, eps at termination
